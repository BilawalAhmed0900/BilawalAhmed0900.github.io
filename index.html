    <p style="font-size: 2em;font-family: 'Merienda';">Projects</p>
    <p>
      I have created various hobby projects over the years. You can take a look at them at my GitHub profile.
      I have listed a few interesting ones here.
    </p>
    <div class="smallHr"></div>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 1.25em;font-family: 'Merienda';">LinkDownloader - <a href="https://github.com/BilawalAhmed0900/LinkDownloader">here</a></p>
    <p>
      It is downloading tool that is vastly better than your average downloading tool especially browser's own downloader.
      It exists in under two names in my GitHub, one as DManager and other as LinkDownloader.
    </p>
    <p>
      First one is created as a 2nd semester's project and was made in collaboration with my classmate. It was written in Java and used MultiThreading.
      It split the downloading in various parts, if the link allows and downloading all of them consecutively for maximum throughput.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later one was created solely by me when I was learning ElectronJS. Due to JS's limitation, it was single-threaded but it still gave
      better or on-opar performance than Chrome's downloading.
    </p>
    <div class="smallHr"></div>
    <br>

    <p style="font-size: 1.25em;font-family: 'Merienda';">LinkDownloader Extension - <a href="https://github.com/BilawalAhmed0900/LinkDownloader_Extension">here</a></p>
    <p>
      It is a set extensions that supports the LinkDownloader/DManager. Both were created in Browser's Extension API on top of JS.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sense, it captures the download some filtering (it cannot start downloading of each and every file) and sends the result
      over a websocket that is captured, read, parsed by LinkDownloader.
    </p>
    <div class="smallHr"></div>
    <br>

    <p style="font-size: 1.25em;font-family: 'Merienda';">BatteryStats - <a href="https://github.com/BilawalAhmed0900/BatteryStats">here</a></p>
    <p>
      It is an Android app that reads the battery statistics from the Android and shows them to the user.
      Most of this information is usually hidden from the user, like battery voltage, current drawn from it, temperature, etc...
    </p>
    <p>
      It is created in Flutter so, it should be available in iOS too, but alas! iOS don't give such information to user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why your app, while others are available on the Play Store? Simple, no ads. :) Currently, under review by Google, link will be posted
      once it is published on the Play Store.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.25em;font-family: 'Merienda';">UpworkFeed - <a href="https://github.com/BilawalAhmed0900/UpworkFeed">here</a></p>
    <p>
      It also a Browser extension but it is really helpful for those working on Upwork. It notifies the user whenever a specific job is posted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was made on a request of a friend and is also made in Browser's extension API on top of JS.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is fully customizable. You can set the time interval for each check, and specify which keyword to check within each job.
      A notification is pushed to user whenever that specific job is posted.
