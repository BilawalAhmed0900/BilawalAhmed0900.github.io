    <p>
      I was born in small town of Punjab Province in Pakistan, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CcNfGUq5P7E1sore8" target="_blank">Muzaffargarh</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent 14 years of life, my kindergarten, primary, middle, higher and higher secondary, pre-engineering in the same institute,
      <a href="https://www.skksmgarh.edu.pk/" target="_blank">Sardar Kaurey Khan Public School/College</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till then, I got interested in computers as I got my first computer at 7 years of age. I first played with batch script of Windows,
      understanding them from just reading, because, then I didn't have any internet access. Then after getting internet, I start reading
      about them and I got good at them. Then, I started making my own scripts in form of game repacks because extracting game
      is just doing a set of steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time, I don't know how, I joined a forum dedicated to different compression techniques and repacking games, <a href="https://fileforums.com/" target="_blank">FileForums</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There, I met a guy with username <i>Razor12911</i>. At that time,
      he was creating a software for making dynamic GUIs for installers named ASC (probably Advanced Setup Creator).
      I bacame its more-or-less beta-tester and made a few skins in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same forums I came into contact me a guy (ShivShubh) who later became founder of a team Corepacks and another (Amsal), who founded Darck Repacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was specially found of various compression technique but my brain couldn't even comprehend Huffman because I couldn't understand Trees
      (I was still in late middle/early high school student at that age).
    </p>
    <p>
      I got under mentorship of Razor12911, as I started building my first software using Delphi (using RAD Studio). After like 8-10 months,
      I lost contact with him and we started Darck Repacks. I made few repacks for them and few softwares on their website.
      At that time, I reached end of my high school and needed to persue my studies. I retired from Darck (as most of us did).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was the time for me selecting a good university for my studies because it is <b>absolutely</b> necessary in Pakistan.
      I shortlisted National University of Science and Technology and Comsats and started preparing for them.
      I got selected in both of them but ultimately, I went NUST.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently studying there and I am in 4th year of my Software Engineering. I joined <a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM</a> within this timeline and left it.
    </p>
